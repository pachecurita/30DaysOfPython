# 30 days of Python
`2021-09-01 Wednesday`
These are my solutions to the [30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python "30-Days-Of-Python") challenge proposed by [Asabeneth](https://github.com/Asabeneh "Asabeneth") and that I met thanks to [JaviCeRodriguez](https://github.com/JaviCeRodriguez "JaviCeRodriguez")  in the Discord community called [FrontendCafé](https://frontend.cafe "FrontendCafé"). I am just starting to learn Python since 2 months ago, so this challenge suits me very well.
